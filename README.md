# greedyTSP
This project demonstrates the use of a greedy algorithm called closest edge insertion to find a solution within 20% of optimal to the Traveling Salesman Problem.

This program is written in C++, takes input of the coordinates where the Traveling Salesman must stop from a file, and then outputs the closest edge insertion path after each iteration. It also outputs the time it took to determine a solution and the solution path distance.
